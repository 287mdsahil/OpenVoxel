# Voxel based 3d game

Not much to say. Currently in very early stages. :)

## Compiling:

`opengl`, `glfw3` and `glew` and compilation dependencies. Make sure these are installed.

Simply use `make` to compile. Then execute the executable in `bin` to run the demo.

### Check it out:

### Controls:

use mouse to look around

use `tab_key` to toggle cursor capture

use `w`,`a`,`s`,`d` for movement
